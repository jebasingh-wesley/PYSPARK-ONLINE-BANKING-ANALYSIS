# Pyspark-Bank-Analysis

## Online Banking Analysis

### Technologies Used
- Spark SQL
- Spark HDFS
- Hive

### Overview
This project marks our initial venture into Apache Spark. We focused on online banking analysis by leveraging various datasets from Kaggle, including loans, customer credit cards, and transactions. After downloading these datasets, we cleaned the data and utilized tools and technologies like Spark, HDFS, and Hive to execute various use cases.

### Dataflow and Process
1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Retrieved datasets from Kaggle.
    - Stored datasets in cloud storage.
    - Imported data from MySQL to Hive using Sqoop.

2. **Data Processing**:
    - Processed large datasets in Hive.
    - Analyzed data using PySpark in Jupyter Notebook by implementing several use cases.

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Team Collaboration**: Worked in a team of 6 members using Git/GitHub for version control.
- **Data Collection**: Utilized historical data from Kaggle.com, focusing on online transactions, loans, and customer credit card datasets.
- **Data Loading**: Implemented Spark Session to load data into DataFrames.
- **Execution**: Used standalone cluster mode in the Spark environment to run Spark SQL queries.
